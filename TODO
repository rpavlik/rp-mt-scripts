Bugs/Todo/Ideas:
---------------
 - Detect config and install status based on flag presence and automatically open to the appropriate tab.
 - Pass an argument to scripts to eliminate timeout on exit, as an option?
 - Make graphical buttons for config+install or just config not give the user the option to do the other (aka, run automatically)
 - Make sure all scripts kill FLOSC correctly so that PyMT and others can correctly access touch data.  (Create a FLOSC kill script?)
 - Add open source licensing (MIT/BSD?)
