Todo:
-----
 - Look through dpkg logs and make sure I am installing all needed packages
 - Test system on a blank 9.04 install (vmware, use snapshots)
 - Make sure all scripts kill FLOSC correctly and/or investigate Touche so that PyMT and others can correctly access touch data.  (Create a FLOSC kill script?)
 - Add open source licensing (MIT/BSD?)
