Quickstart:
-----------

Make sure that all these files are in a directory of their own:
that is, you should have a rp-mt-scripts/ directory that just contains the files
from this software.

If you want to do this graphically, double-click the file "rp-mt-scripts-graphical.py"
in that directory and choose "Run", then click Configure and Install.

cd into that directory in a terminal.

./configure

You may choose to install at the end of that script, or manually install using
the individual scripts in the scripts directory.  All files stay within the
directory: the only exceptions are debian packages properly installed (for
dependencies and pymt as a python library, packaged) and the optional global
libpoco workaround (the local version is the default).

On a 1Mbit internet connection, it takes about 30 minutes for this to complete.

Requirements:
-------------
 - Ubuntu 9.04 (Ubuntu 8.10 works partially but you must manually backport some packages, including python-liblo )
