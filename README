README for rp-mt-scripts
rp-mt-scripts: Copyright 2009, Ryan Pavlik <ryan.pavlik@snc.edu>

I'll put them under an open-source license later, but for now, all rights reserved.
You can download them directly from me, but please do not re-distribute them: not
quite good enough quality yet.

Quickstart:
-----------

Make sure that all these files are in a directory of their own:
that is, you should have a rp-mt-scripts/ directory that just contains the files
from this software.

cd into that directory in a terminal.

./configure

You may choose to install at the end of that script, or manually install using
the individual scripts in the scripts directory.  All files stay within the
directory: the only exceptions are debian packages properly installed (for
dependencies and pymt as a python library, packaged) and the optional global
libpoco workaround (the local version is the default).

Requirements:
-------------
 - Ubuntu 9.04 (Ubuntu 8.10 works partially but you must manually backport some packages, including python-liblo )
